# night_writer

This project will convert English .txt files into braille and braille.txt files into text.

**Things to note:** 
* As of now, this will only work with lowercase letters and basic punctuation (see data/dictionary.csv)
* The braille is represented with `0`'s as raised dots and `.`'s as flat spaces. For example, "a" would look like:
```
0.
..
..
```
